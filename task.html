                    users and site owners. This pack has eight services website templates as of writing this post. All
                    demos follow a content-rich layout to let you clearly explain how you can help businesses grow. Case
                    study pages are given instead of portfolio pages. You can use the client study pages to share some
                    interesting stories of how you helped your client’s business. Since it is an HTML template, all
                    pages and features are functional only from the front-end side.</p>

                <p>Roofit is a roofing services website template. The bright red color scheme gets user attention as
                    soon as they land on your website. Placing the types of services you offer right below the homepage
                    header section is a wise move. Users can easily click on the service they want without scrolling a
                    lot. Animation effects and scroll effects are well-calibrated; hence, you don’t see any lag and
                    flickery effect. Video spaces are there in the default design itself. Being an HTML5 website
                    template, it can handle videos and other multimedia content without any hitch. You can even use this
                    template for your raw HTML website.</p>
